Death-Spawn
===========

GVR original plugin for bukkit.




Why hello there. Ready to accept the task of scripting the backbone of GVRMC?

well good.

Let me start out with what it is meant to do.

  This plugin is to be the backbone of the entire server. So its going to do a lot. what exactly? well, let me draw you a picture.
 You are a regular user and you decided to choose greece. why? i don't know, nor do i care, but thats not important. so now you are a greek citizen. great. you go make some money, build yourself a house, get some food, trade for some cobble from the romans, maybe you even join the army. great now you are a greek warrior. hmm... LETS GO TO WAR. your king decided to declare war on rome and you are sent into battle. YAY lets go kill some people. you go through many souls and start bombing some houses. then someone comes from behind and kills you. now heres where DS kicks in. instead of spawning you back at home and you dropping all your shit, all you dropped was your weapons and your armor. everything else stays in your inventory. well aint that nice, you dont lose your diamonds. but thats not all it does. what DS does is it sets your player to be in “DEAD” mode and now your home is on the ferry in the underworld. hmm... so you die, and go to hell. what's the point of that? well it gives people a reason to go to hell and it allows for hades to set traps, quests, and other things in the underworld. Now you're in hell and you notice that there are no rules here. Thats cool. one word. GANGS. shit. now your running down this walkway and you notice a sign that say “hey you can get out of here!” so you follow the path that it tells you to go down and you find yourself facing a gang guarding the way out. (the gang is the users not part of the plugin) they say “pay and you'll get out alive”. cool. you spawned in the underworld with 1 of your drachmas. ALRIGHT. but you don't want to pay these guys. so you save you gold coin and they kill you. now you spawn back at the boat and you still only have one coin. how you gonna get out? so you pay them or sneak past them, whatever, because the gang isn't part of the plugin, they are actual players. so you get to the portal the the “Fields of Punishment”. you enter and you're faced with a challenge. at the end of this said challenge you see a sign/button whatever, (this is part of the plugin) and you do whatever to activate it. suddenly you are spawned back into the normal world and you have all your normal money back along with your old inventory (with the exception of your armor) and you run back to the safety of your house.
 YAY. now wasn’t that a nice adventure?


Now lets break this apart. 
on death
-drop only armor and weapons
-new inventory for the nether
-new currency balance
-/home reset to the ferry in the underworld
in the nether
-no rules
-PVP allowed
-separate economy
-switch to become living again

on return
-get your shit back
-get your money back
-protected from pvp for 3 minutes but cannot deal damage
-home set back to what it was before
-teleported back to spawn


Seem simple enough? great.
